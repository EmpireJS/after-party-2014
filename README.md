Program the walls and win!

Please let us know if you need any other scripts to get your visualization running and we'll be happy to get you started. The meat of the code is in `js/main.js` which just:

1. Displays our [Code of Conduct]
2. Adds `<section id="put-stuff-here">`

**EVERYTHING WILL GET RESET EVERY THREE MINUTES** The whole page is just a very vanilla HTML5BP. Feel free to change anything you want!
